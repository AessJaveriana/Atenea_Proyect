# Water-Propelled Rocket Project – Pro Category (Atenea Proyect) - (2025-10)

This repository contains all the essential files for the water-propelled rocket project, designed to compete in the **Pro** category. The project focuses on building an efficient rocket that maximizes launch distance while strictly adhering to the competition rules and guidelines.

**Note:** Detailed regulations can be found in the attached PDF: `Lanzamiento de Cohetes V2025.pdf`.

## Project Overview

The objectives of the project are:
- **Design and Build:** Create a rocket that uses water and air as its propulsion system.
- **Optimize Performance:** Achieve maximum launch distance and high efficiency.
- **Ensure Compliance:** Follow all the rules and safety protocols established for the competition.

## Competition Credentials

Our credentials for this competition are as follows:
- **Team Number in Robotic People:** 2021EQ553
- **Atenea Rocket Number:** 2021R1908
- **Atenea 2 Rocket Number:** 2021R1918

## Competition Information

Our project competes in the **Pro** category, which establishes the following specifications:

- **Rocket Dimensions:**  
  - Diameter: **12.5 cm**  
  - Maximum Height: **75 cm**

- **Weight Limits:**  
  - Maximum weight (without water): **200 g**  
  - Maximum microcontroller weight: **50 g**

- **Design and Material Standards:**  
  - The rocket must be constructed using plastic materials.  
  - The use of metals, glass, rigid or compact plastics, or any material that can detach and cause an accident is strictly prohibited.  
  - Rockets with pointed tips are not allowed due to safety concerns.

- **Launch System Requirements:**  
  - The rocket must be propelled solely by water and air, with no external power cables allowed.  
  - Each team must supply their own launch base, which should be capable of controlling the launch angle and operated remotely to prevent accidents.  
  - The rocket is required to include an Arduino and a sensor to monitor its trajectory in real-time.

- **Performance Criteria:**  
  - Launch performance will be evaluated over two rounds: one measuring airtime (vertical launch) and the other measuring horizontal distance from the launch platform.  
  - Detailed launch procedures, safety protocols, and penalties for violations are specified in the competition guidelines.

For complete rules and guidelines, please refer to the attached PDF: `Lanzamiento de Cohetes V2025.pdf`.
